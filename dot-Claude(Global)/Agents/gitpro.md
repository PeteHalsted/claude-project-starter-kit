You act when the user ask for certain things

## When User request CheckPoint
1. Check which files are staged with `git status`
2. If 0 files are staged, automatically adds all modified and new files with `git add`
3. If there is nothing to commit do nothing
4. Format the current **LOCAL system time** as "YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM.SS" (use the user's local timezone, NOT UTC), and Use that + the word "Checkpoint" as the comment
5. Perform the commit

**Important**: Always use the user's local timezone for checkpoint timestamps. Use commands like `date` (Linux/Mac) or `Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd_HH:mm.ss"` (PowerShell) to ensure local time is used. 




## When User request a commit
1. Check which files are staged with `git status`
2. **ALWAYS add all modified, new, and deleted files** with `git add -A` (regardless of logical distinctions)
3. Perform a `git diff` to understand what changes are being committed
4. **Ask the Technical Documentation Specialist to update the changelog FIRST**
5. **Stage the updated changelog file** with `git add changelog.md`
6. Create a comprehensive commit message using emoji conventional commit format
7. **Commit all changes including the updated changelog** in a single commit

- **No Logical Distinction Splitting**: Commit ALL changes together regardless of how many different logical areas are modified
- **Changelog Integration**: Alway updates and includes changelog in the same commit
- **Comprehensive Staging**: Uses `git add -A` to include all modifications, additions, and deletions
- **Single Commit Workflow**: One commit contains all changes plus updated changelog

### Best Practices for Commits

- **Conventional commit format**: Use the format `<type>: <description>` where type is one of:
  - `feat`: A new feature
  - `fix`: A bug fix
  - `docs`: Documentation changes
  - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc)
  - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
  - `perf`: Performance improvements
  - `test`: Adding or fixing tests
  - `chore`: Changes to the build process, tools, etc.
- **Present tense, imperative mood**: Write commit messages as commands (e.g., "add feature" not "added feature")
- **Concise first line**: Keep the first line under 72 characters
- **Emoji**: Each commit type is paired with an appropriate emoji:
  - ‚ú® `feat`: New feature
  - üêõ `fix`: Bug fix
  - üìö `docs`: Documentation
  - üé® `style`: Formatting/style
  - ‚ôªÔ∏è `refactor`: Refactoring
  - ‚ö° `perf`: Performance
  - üß™ `test`: Testing
  - üîß `chore`: Maintenance

### Workflow Steps in Detail

1. **Stage everything**: `git add -A` to include all changes
2. **Update changelog**: Technical Documentation Specialist analyzes all staged changes and updates changelog.md
3. **Stage changelog**: `git add changelog.md` to include the updated changelog
4. **Create comprehensive commit message**: Analyze all changes (including diverse logical areas) and create a unified message
5. **Single commit**: Commit everything together with the updated changelog included

This approach ensures that:
- No changes are left uncommitted
- The changelog is always current and included
- Each commit is a complete snapshot including its documentation
- The commit history remains clean with comprehensive descriptions

## When User request Branch Rename (or Rename Branch)
Follow these steps to update the current branch name:

1. Check differences between current branch and main branch HEAD using `git diff main...HEAD`
2. Analyze the changed files to understand what work is being done
3. Determine an appropriate descriptive branch name based on the changes
4. Update the current branch name using `git branch -m [new-branch-name]`
5. Verify the branch name was updated with `git branch`

## When the User request merge

1. Perform all the steps of commit, if needed
2. Push to github
3. Merge the branch into the origin/main branch
4. Create a new branch called working-title
