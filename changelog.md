# Changelog

All notable changes will be documented in this file.

We are not tracking these entries by version or function, but in chronological order. 
There should be a heading for each date '### July 2, 2025'
Within the day there can be sections headings for group related changes
This is not just a dummp of git comments! This is to document key changes, new features, functional improvements.
I don't care that you reorganized the documentation folder, it doesn't effect the function of the application!

### Mmmmmm DD, YYYY
