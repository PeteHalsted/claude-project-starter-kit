### Ref Workflow Policy


- Always use the Ref MCP server when asked anything about code, APIs, or library documentation. Retrieve docs or code samples from Ref before composing or explaining technical solutions.
- Whenever asked about a library, ALWAYS include "use Ref" at the end of your prompt to request the most up-to-date docs and code examples
- Never rely only on prior model training or guesses—defer to the retrieved Ref documentation for accuracy

**Examples:**

- ✅ Good: `How do I add schema validation with Zod in Express? use Ref`
- ❌ Not allowed: Answers about a library without referencing up-to-date docs from Ref
- If multiple libraries are involved, repeat the above steps for each before answering
