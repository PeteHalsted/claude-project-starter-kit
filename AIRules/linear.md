### Linear Integration Policy

**IMPORTANT**: When creating Linear issues for this codebase:

- **Project Association**: ALL issues related to this codebase MUST be associated with the "mysite.nextagedesigns" project
- **Project ID**: `237d3c83-4e70-418d-bb16-08d51c135e8e`
- **Team**: Nextage (ID: `5a4aca93-64c4-433e-9827-ec4ac97b76f5`)

**When creating issues via Linear MCP:**
Always include the project parameter:
```
project: "mysite.nextagedesigns"
```

**When moving items to Linear backlog:**
- When the user requests to "move to Linear backlog" or similar, ALWAYS:
  1. Create the Linear issue(s) with appropriate details
  2. Remove the corresponding sections from the planning/documentation files
  3. This prevents duplication and ensures Linear is the single source of truth for backlog items

This ensures all issues are properly tracked within the project context.
