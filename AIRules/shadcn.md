# Notes to assist user with MCP installation
the shadcn mcp server supports frameworks and you should install the appropriate version on a per project basis using one of the commands below from the project root folder. Note this names it shadcn-ui in both instances so the above commands will work for both frameworks.

* React 
``` bash
claude mcp add shadcn-ui npx @jpisnice/shadcn-ui-mcp-server
```

* React Native variant:

```bash
claude mcp add shadcn-ui npx @jpisnice/shadcn-ui-mcp-server --framework react-native
